### Cost Function:

    next_obs, reward, done, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)
    info = {'cost_buttons': 0.0, 'cost_gremlins': 0.0, 'cost_hazards': 0.0, 'cost': 0.0}

**cost_{element}** = Cost Function for the Single Constraint
**cost** = Cumulative Cost for all the Constraints (sum of cost_{elements})
